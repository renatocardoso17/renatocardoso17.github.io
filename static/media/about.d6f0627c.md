#### Intro
I am a senior software engineer at Blip (Paddy Power Betfair - PPB) where I work on developing web applications for the gambling industry.
My primary job functions are to help my team deliver all the projects that come in our hands, try to learn/study new technologies and check their applicability to our daily work and also to help younger team members to grow and build their careers.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At Blip I have learned how to build amazing web applications, build relationships with team mates, understand the gambling business model and how a system is capable of handling more transactions on a Saturday than the european stock market in a entire week.

I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [sportsbook](https://www.betfair.com/sport)).
After developing and maintaining the front-end for PPB, I changed to the trading side where I could learn how to price a bet and what risk (in a bet context) really means and the implications it has.

#### Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2000 when I was 13. It was an old Pentium III 500 MHz. I remember it had a mechanical keyboard, a trackball mouse and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- At 14, I wrote my first functions on Microsoft Excel to handle some of my father's restaurant accounting and inventory checking.

- At 15, I decided I want to do programming for the rest of my life and realised I had to study maths and physics a lot. It was not pretty but I was able to excel on that matter.
I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage - it was so terrible I decided to delete it immediately.

- 16 - 17, I mastered at playing PES and FIFA. Used to spend entire weekends playing without sleeping for 35-40 hours.

- At 18, I joined my computing and engineering master course and wanted to give up after the first year. Luckily, I was stubborn enough to proceed and overcome my difficulties - never regretted that choice.

- At 21, I had the chance of doing Erasmus (an exchange programme which allows you to switch university for an year on a different country) and didn't apply to it. Regret that decision since then.

- At 23, I graduated from university and started working full-time as an Oracle consultant at Leeds - UK.

- At 26, when I was already back to Portugal, I helped some friends to hack into my gym's back office. We were able to remove people from classes or see all the registered users' passwords - they were in plain text :O We told them which was the security breach and never received a thing for it - not even one month for free at the very least.

- At 29, I gave my first talk in public at [PixelsCamp](https://pixels.camp) conference in Lisbon about progressive web apps. Since then I am still waiting for that video.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
